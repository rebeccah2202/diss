## Lake heatwaves under climate change

[*Paper*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03119-1)

**Greenhouse Gas Scenarios**

- For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 ± 0.1 to 5.4 ± 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 ± 0.4 to 95.5 ± 35.3 days.  

- In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 ± 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 ± 7.6 days 


**Effects of changes in lake temperatures**   
Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society

- dependence of the average intensity and duration of heatwave events on average lake depth 

- lake depth explains a large proportion of the variability in lake heatwaves within each lake thermal region 


**Knowledge gap**   
Knowledge gap of how heatwaves in lakes will change - concern given the high vulnerability of lakes to thermal extremes, and the ecosystem goods and services that they provide
